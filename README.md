## Statistical Analysis of Network Data with R

### Where to buy?

Coming soon.

### The sand package

Coming soon to CRAN. In the meanwhile you can install it
directly from github using the `devtools` package:

```
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("kolaczyk/sand/sand")
```

### The code

All R code from the book is included in the
[sand/inst/code directory above]
(https://github.com/kolaczyk/sand/tree/master/sand/inst/code).

You can run the code from the `sand` package itself,
see `?sand` for the details.
